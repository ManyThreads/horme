## Description

The HorME project aims at exploring emergent software systems in the context of an AAL (Ambient Assisted Living) scenario using modern IoT technologies.
The premise of equipping the appartments of elderly people with sensors and actors in order to enalbe them to continue an independent and dignified life in their own home while still providing to the facilities to react to emergencies in an automated, reliable and timely manner presents a multitude of challenges that often are at odds with traditional approaches to software development.

## Funding

The HorMe project is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) of Germany under Grant No. 01IS18072 from May 2019 to April 2022.
